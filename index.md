# Welcome to LowPy (Pre-release)!
<p align="center"><img src="logo.png" height="100px"></p>

**LowPy** is a high level GPU simulator of low level device characteristics in machine algorithms. It seeks to streamline the investigation process when considering memristive and other novel devices for implementing a machine learning algorithm in hardware. By using the familiar [Keras](https://keras.io) syntax, it will be second nature to write GPU-optimized code to push your algorithm to its limits.

# System Requirements
LowPy was designed with Python 3, and has not been tested on previous versions of Python. Beyond this, if you can run [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org) + [Keras](https://keras.io), you can run LowPy. If you can run [TensorFlow with GPU support](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu), you can run LowPy with GPU support. While it is technically possible to run TensorFlow and LowPy, it is fairly challenging to set up, and has not yet been tested with LowPy.

# Installation
To install the latest version of LowPy, use `pip`:
```
pip install lowpy
```
